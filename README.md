# Human Voice Gender Classification and Clustering

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project classifies human voices as **Male** or **Female** using a machine learning model (Random Forest Classifier) 
and also provides an option to perform **unsupervised clustering** (K-Means) on voice features.

The project includes:
1. **Classification** â€“ Supervised ML model to predict gender from voice features.
2. **Clustering** â€“ Grouping similar voices without labels.
3. **Streamlit App** â€“ Interactive interface for predictions.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
1. **preprocess.py**
   - Loads dataset from CSV
   - Cleans missing data
   - Scales features using StandardScaler
   - Splits into training and testing sets

2. **train_model.py**
   - Trains a Random Forest Classifier
   - Evaluates model (Accuracy, Classification Report, Confusion Matrix)
   - Saves trained model as `voice_classifier.pkl`

3. **cluster_model.py**
   - Performs K-Means clustering
   - Calculates silhouette score
   - Option to plot clusters

4. **app.py**
   - Streamlit app for interactive predictions
   - Upload CSV with voice features
   - Preprocess and predict using saved model
   - Displays results in a table

5. **voice_classifier.pkl**
   - Pre-trained Random Forest model saved with joblib

---

## ðŸ›  Requirements
Install dependencies before running:
pip install pandas scikit-learn streamlit matplotlib joblib

- Trains the classifier
- Saves model to `voice_classifier.pkl`

### 2. Launch the Streamlit App
Run:
- Opens app in your browser
- Upload CSV with the same feature columns used for training

---

## ðŸ“Š Dataset Format
CSV must have:
- **Features**: numerical columns (e.g., meanfreq, sd, median, Q25, Q75, etc.)
- **Label**: 'label' column with values `male` or `female` (only for training/testing)

Example:
meanfreq,sd,median,Q25,Q75,label
0.059781,0.064241,0.056286,0.031302,0.082253,male
0.066009,0.067420,0.068275,0.043109,0.089885,female
